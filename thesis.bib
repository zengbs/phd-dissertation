	abstract = {We introduce CAFE, a new independent code designed to solve the equations of relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) in three dimensions. We present the standard tests for an RMHD code and for the relativistic hydrodynamics regime because we have not reported them before. The tests include the one-dimensional Riemann problems related to blast waves, head-on collisions of streams, and states with transverse velocities, with and without magnetic field, which is aligned or transverse, constant or discontinuous across the initial discontinuity. Among the two-dimensional (2D) and 3D tests without magnetic field, we include the 2D Riemann problem, a one-dimensional shock tube along a diagonal, the high-speed Emery wind tunnel, the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability, a set of jets, and a 3D spherical blast wave, whereas in the presence of a magnetic field we show the magnetic rotor, the cylindrical explosion, a case of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, and a 3D magnetic field advection loop. The code uses high-resolution shock-capturing methods, and we present the error analysis for a combination that uses the Harten, Lax, van Leer, and Einfeldt (HLLE) flux formula combined with a linear, piecewise parabolic method and fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory reconstructors. We use the flux-constrained transport and the divergence cleaning methods to control the divergence-free magnetic field constraint.}

	abstract = {We describe a new Godunov algorithm for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) that combines a simple, unsplit second-order accurate integrator with the constrained transport (CT) method for enforcing the solenoidal constraint on the magnetic field. A variety of approximate Riemann solvers are implemented to compute the fluxes of the conserved variables. The methods are tested with a comprehensive suite of multi-dimensional problems. These tests have helped us develop a hierarchy of correction steps that are applied when the integration algorithm predicts unphysical states due to errors in the fluxes, or errors in the inversion between conserved and primitive variables. Although used exceedingly rarely, these corrections dramatically improve the stability of the algorithm. We present preliminary results from the application of these algorithms to two problems in RMHD: the propagation of supersonic magnetized jets and the amplification of magnetic field by turbulence driven by the relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Both of these applications reveal important differences between the results computed with Riemann solvers that adopt different approximations for the fluxes. For example, we show that the use of Riemann solvers that include both contact and rotational discontinuities can increase the strength of the magnetic field within the cocoon by a factor of 10 in simulations of RMHD jets and can increase the spectral resolution of three-dimensional RMHD turbulence driven by the KHI by a factor of two. This increase in accuracy far outweighs the associated increase in computational cost. Our RMHD scheme is publicly available as part of the Athena code.}

	abstract = {We present a description of the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation of the PLUTO code for solving the equations of classical and special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD and RMHD). The current release exploits, in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the cell center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport Upwind method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step where piecewise parabolic method, weighted essentially non-oscillatory, or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated. The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier providing propagation and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme to include non-ideal dissipative processes, such as viscosity, resistivity, and anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.}

	abstract = {The ideal gas equation of state with a constant adiabatic index, although commonly used in relativistic hydrodynamics, is a poor approximation for most relativistic astrophysical flows. Here we propose a new general equation of state for a multi-component relativistic gas which is consistent with the Synge equation of state for a relativistic perfect gas and is suitable for numerical (special) relativistic hydrodynamics. We also present a multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamic code incorporating the proposed general equation of state, based on the HLL scheme, which does not make use of a full characteristic decomposition of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. The accuracy and robustness of this code is demonstrated in multidimensional calculations through several highly relativistic test problems taking into account nonvanishing tangential velocities. Results from three-dimensional simulations of relativistic jets show that the morphology and dynamics of the relativistic jets are significantly influenced by the different equation of state and by different compositions of relativistic perfect gases. Our new numerical code, combined with our proposed equation of state, is very efficient and robust, and unlike previous codes, it gives very accurate results for thermodynamic variables in relativistic astrophysical flows.}

After a discussion of the equations solved and of the techniques employed, we present a series of testbeds carried out to validate the code and assess its accuracy.

The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts.

We discuss the application of an existing relativistic, hydrodynamic primitive variable recovery algorithm to a study of pulsar winds, and, in particular, the refinement made to admit such ultra-relativistic flows. We show that an iterative quartic root finder breaks down for Lorentz factors above 102 and employ an analytic root finder as a solution. We find that the former, which is known to be robust for Lorentz factors up to at least 50, offers a 24% speed advantage. We demonstrate the existence of a simple diagnostic allowing for a hybrid primitives recovery algorithm that includes an automatic, real-time toggle between the iterative and analytical methods. We further determine the accuracy of the iterative and hybrid algorithms for a comprehensive selection of input parameters and demonstrate the latter’s capability to elucidate the internal structure of ultra-relativistic plasmas. In particular, we discuss simulations showing that the interaction of a light, ultra-relativistic pulsar wind with a slow, dense ambient medium can give rise to asymmetry reminiscent of the Guitar nebula leading to the formation of a relativistic backflow harboring a series of internal shockwaves. The shockwaves provide thermalized energy that is available for the continued inflation of the PWN bubble. In turn, the bubble enhances the asymmetry, thereby providing positive feedback to the backflow."

The ideal constant Γ-law EoS, commonly adopted in a wide range of astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic EoS that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focuses on three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic EoS on the propagation of fast magnetosonic shocks is investigated. This calls into question the validity of the constant Γ-law EoS in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across hydromagnetic waves. Secondly, we present a new inversion scheme to recover primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative ones that allows for a general EoS and avoids catastrophic numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits. Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a realistic EoS can considerably bear upon the solution when transitions from cold to hot gas (or vice versa) are present. Under these circumstances, a polytropic EoS can significantly endanger the solution.}",

This is partly because observational tests of jet formation models suffer from the limited angular resolution of ground-based very-long-baseline interferometry that has thus far been able to probe the structure of the jet acceleration and collimation region in only two sources2,3. Here, we report observations of 3C84 (NGC 1275)--the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster--made with an interferometric array including the orbiting radio telescope of the RadioAstron4mission. The data transversely resolve the edge-brightened jet in 3C84 only 30 μas from the core, which is ten times closer to the central engine than was possible in previous ground-based observations5and allows us to measure the jet collimation profile from ~102 to ~104 gravitational radii (rg) from the black hole. The previously found5, almost cylindrical jet profile on scales larger than a few thousand rg is seen to continue at least down to a few hundred rg from the black hole, and we find a broad jet with a transverse radius of ≳250 rg at only 350 rg from the core. This implies that either the bright outer jet layer goes through a very rapid lateral expansion on scales ≲102 rg or it is launched from the accretion disk.},

  abstract  = {A Riemann problem with prescribed initial conditions will produce one of three possible wave patterns corresponding to the propagation of the different discontinuities that will be produced once the system is allowed to relax. In general, when solving the Riemann problem numerically, the determination of the specific wave pattern produced is obtained through some initial guess which can be successively discarded or improved. We here discuss a new procedure, suitable for implementation in an exact Riemann solver in one dimension, which removes the initial ambiguity in the wave pattern. In particular we focus our attention on the relativistic velocity jump between the two initial states and use this to determine, through some analytic conditions, the wave pattern produced by the decay of the initial discontinuity. The exact Riemann problem is then solved by means of calculating the root of a nonlinear equation. Interestingly, in the case of two rarefaction waves, this root can even be found analytically. Our procedure is straightforward to implement numerically and improves the efficiency of numerical codes based on exact Riemann solvers.},

The Harten–Lax–van Leer contact wave (HLLC) solver, originally developed by Toro, Spruce and Spears, generalizes the algorithm described in a previous paper to the case where magnetic fields are present. The solution to the Riemann problem is approximated by two constant states bounded by two fast shocks and separated by a tangential wave. The scheme is Jacobian-free, in the sense that it avoids the expensive characteristic decomposition of the RMHD equations and it improves over the HLL scheme by restoring the missing contact wave.Multidimensional integration proceeds via the single step, corner transport upwind (CTU) method of Colella, combined with the constrained transport (CT) algorithm to preserve divergence-free magnetic fields. The resulting numerical scheme is simple to implement, efficient and suitable for a general equation of state.

abstract = { AbstractPulsars steadily dissipate their rotational energy via relativistic winds. Confinement of these outflows generates luminous pulsar wind nebulae, seen across the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton emission and in optical emission lines when they shock the surrounding medium. These sources act as important probes of relativistic shocks, particle acceleration, and interstellar gas. We review the many recent advances in the study of pulsar wind nebulae, with particular focus on the evolutionary stages through which these objects progress as they expand into their surroundings, and on morphological structures within these nebulae that directly trace the physical processes of particle acceleration and outflow. We conclude by considering some exciting new probes of pulsar wind nebulae, including the study of TeV gamma-ray emission from these sources, and observations of pulsar winds in close binary systems. }

The AMR implementation is based on a hierarchy of grid patches with an oct-tree data structure. We adopt a three-dimensional relaxing total variation diminishing scheme for the hydrodynamic solver and a multi-level relaxation scheme for the Poisson solver. Both solvers have been implemented in GPU, by which hundreds of patches can be advanced in parallel. The computational overhead associated with the data transfer between the CPU and GPU is carefully reduced by utilizing the capability of asynchronous memory copies in GPU, and the computing time of the ghost-zone values for each patch is diminished by overlapping it with the GPU computations. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code by performing several standard test problems in astrophysics. GAMER is a parallel code that can be run in a multi-GPU cluster system. We measure the performance of the code by performing purely baryonic cosmological simulations in different hardware implementations, in which detailed timing analyses provide comparison between the computations with and without GPU(s) acceleration. Maximum speed-up factors of 12.19 and 10.47 are demonstrated using one GPU with 40963 effective resolution and 16 GPUs with 81923 effective resolution, respectively.},

In order to get a general analytical solution for this problem, we analyse the properties of the relativistic flow across shock waves and rarefactions. As in classical hydrodynamics, the solution of the Riemann problem is found by solving an implicit algebraic equation which gives the pressure in the intermediate states. The solution presented here contains as a particular case the special relativistic shock-tube problem in which the gas is initially at rest. Finally, we discuss the impact of this result on the development of high-resolution shock-capturing numerical codes to solve the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics.},

Evidence is presented that: ▪ Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. ▪ AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. ▪ Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. ▪ Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron γ-rays. ▪ Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. ▪ Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.The observational prospects for securing our understanding of AGN jets are bright. }

    abstract = { Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display a bimodal duration distribution with a separation between the short- and long-duration bursts at about 2 s. The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe), their exclusive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright UV regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (neutron star–neutron star or neutron star–black hole). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005 provided the first insight into their energy scale and environments, as well as established a cosmological origin, a mix of host-galaxy types, and an absence of associated SNe. In this review, I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host-galaxy observations and use this information to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain. On the basis of this association, observations of short GRBs and their afterglows can shed light on the on- and off-axis electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments. }

abstract = "Two types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are observed: short-duration hard spectrum GRBs and long-duration soft spectrum GRBs. For many years long GRBs were the focus of intense research while the lack of observational data limited the study of short-hard GRBs (SHBs). In 2005 a breakthrough occurred following the first detections of SHB afterglows, longer wavelength emission that follows the burst of gamma-rays. Similarly to long GRBs, afterglow detections led to the identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their redshifts. These observations established that SHBs are cosmological relativistic sources that, unlike long GRBs, do not originate from the collapse of massive stars, and therefore constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. One viable model for SHB origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole), in which case SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts of strong gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and observational study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is reviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented here for the first time."

	abstract = {The design and implementation of a new framework for adaptive mesh refinement calculations are described. It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but its flexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a “task list” that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.}

The forward transformation (primitive to conserved) has a closed-form solution, but the inverse transformation (conserved to primitive) requires the solution of a set of five nonlinear equations. Here we discuss the mathematical properties of the inverse transformation and present six numerical methods for performing the inversion. The first method solves the full set of five nonlinear equations directly using a Newton-Raphson scheme and a guess from the previous time step. The other methods reduce the five nonlinear equations to either one or two nonlinear equations that are solved numerically. Comparisons between the methods are made using a survey over phase space, a two-dimensional explosion problem, and a general relativistic MHD accretion disk simulation. The run time of the methods is also examined. Code implementing the schemes is available with the electronic edition of the article.}

It provides a rich set of features, including adaptive time-stepping, several hydrodynamic schemes, magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, particles, star formation, chemistry, and radiative processes with grackle, data analysis with yt, and memory pool for efficient object allocation. gamer-2 is fully bitwise reproducible. For the performance optimization, it adopts hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization and utilizes overlapping CPU computation, GPU computation, and CPU–GPU communication. Load balancing is achieved using a Hilbert space-filling curve on a level-by-level basis without the need to duplicate the entire AMR hierarchy on each MPI process. To provide convincing demonstrations of the accuracy and performance of gamer-2, we directly compare with enzo on isolated disc galaxy simulations and with flash on galaxy cluster merger simulations. We show that the physical results obtained by different codes are in very good agreement, and gamer-2 outperforms enzo and flash by nearly one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, on the Blue Waters supercomputers using 1–256 nodes. More importantly, gamer-2 exhibits similar or even better parallel scalability compared to the other two codes. We also demonstrate good weak and strong scaling using up to 4096 GPUs and 65 536 CPU cores, and achieve a uniform resolution as high as \\$10\\, 240^3\\$ cells. Furthermore, gamer-2 can be adopted as an AMR + GPUs framework and has been extensively used for the wave dark matter simulations. gamer-2 is open source (available at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer) and new contributions are welcome.}",

  abstract  = {We present the newly developed code, GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement code (GAMER), which adopts a novel approach in improving the performance of adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) astrophysical simulations by a large factor with the use of the graphic processing unit (GPU). The AMR implementation is based on a hierarchy of grid patches with an oct-tree data structure. We adopt a three-dimensional relaxing total variation diminishing scheme for the hydrodynamic solver and a multi-level relaxation scheme for the Poisson solver. Both solvers have been implemented in GPU, by which hundreds of patches can be advanced in parallel. The computational overhead associated with the data transfer between the CPU and GPU is carefully reduced by utilizing the capability of asynchronous memory copies in GPU, and the computing time of the ghost-zone values for each patch is diminished by overlapping it with the GPU computations. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code by performing several standard test problems in astrophysics. GAMER is a parallel code that can be run in a multi-GPU cluster system. We measure the performance of the code by performing purely baryonic cosmological simulations in different hardware implementations, in which detailed timing analyses provide comparison between the computations with and without GPU(s) acceleration. Maximum speed-up factors of 12.19 and 10.47 are demonstrated using one GPU with 40963 effective resolution and 16 GPUs with 81923 effective resolution, respectively.},

	abstract = {The Milky Way's million degree gaseous halo contains a considerable amount of mass that, depending on its structural properties, can be a significant mass component. In order to analyze the structure of the Galactic halo, we use XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer archival data and measure O vii Kα absorption-line strengths toward 26 active galactic nuclei, LMC X-3, and two Galactic sources (4U 1820-30 and X1735-444). We assume a β-model as the underlying gas density profile and find best-fit parameters of n○ = 0.46 cm−3, rc = 0.35 kpc, and β = 0.71. These parameters result in halo masses ranging between M(18 kpc) = 7.5 and M(200 kpc) = 3.8 assuming a gas metallicity of Z = 0.3 Z☉, which are consistent with current theoretical and observational work. The maximum baryon fraction from our halo model of fb = 0.07 is significantly smaller than the universal value of fb = 0.171, implying the mass contained in the Galactic halo accounts for 10%–50% of the missing baryons in the Milky Way. We also discuss our model in the context of several Milky Way observables, including ram pressure stripping in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the observed X-ray emission measure in the 0.5–2 keV band, the Milky Way's star formation rate, spatial and thermal properties of cooler gas (∼105 K), and the observed Fermi bubbles toward the Galactic center. Although the metallicity of the halo gas is a large uncertainty in our analysis, we place a lower limit on the halo gas between the Sun and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that Z ≳ 0.2 Z☉ based on the pulsar dispersion measure toward the LMC.}

(1) We confirm previous observations of a bump in the dust-correlated spectrum, consistent with the Draine & Lazarian spinning dust model. (2) We also confirm the “haze” signal in the inner Galaxy, and argue that it does not follow a free-free spectrum as first thought, but instead is synchrotron emission from a hard electron cosmic-ray population. (3) In a departure from previous work, we allow the spectrum of Hα-correlated emission (which is used to trace the free-free component) to float in the fit, and find that it does not follow the expected free-free spectrum. Instead there is a bump near 50 GHz, modifying the spectrum at the 20% level, which we speculate is caused by spinning dust in the warm ionized medium. (4) The derived cross-correlation spectra are not sensitive to the map zero points, but are sensitive to the choice of CMB estimator. In cases where the CMB estimator is derived by minimizing variance of a linear combination of the WMAP bands, we show that a bias proportional to the cross-correlation of each template and the true CMB is always present. This bias can be larger than any of the foreground signals in some bands. (5) Lastly, we consider the frequency coverage and sensitivity of the Planck mission, and suggest linear combination coefficients for the CMB template that will reduce both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the synchrotron and haze spectra by more than an order of magnitude.}

    abstract = { We survey the theory and experimental tests for the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy up to energies of 1015 eV. A guide to the previous reviews and essential literature is given, followed by an exposition of basic principles. The basic ideas of cosmic-ray propagation are described, and the physical origin of its processes is explained. The various techniques for computing the observational consequences of the theory are described and contrasted. These include analytical and numerical techniques. We present the comparison of models with data, including direct and indirect—especially γ-ray—observations, and indicate what we can learn about cosmic-ray propagation. Some important topics, including electron and antiparticle propagation, are chosen for discussion. }

day={01},
volume={463},
number={7277},

abstract={There is ample evidence of a magnetic field near the centre of our Galaxy, but much uncertainty as to its strength. Estimates vary from the microgauss to the milligauss range --- and values as great as 1,000 microgauss, about 10,000 times stronger than typical for the bulk of the Galaxy, have been reported. A new analysis of published radio and $\gamma$-ray data reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum that suggests a Galactic Centre magnetic field of 50 microgauss or more. Taken with other evidence, the authors conclude that a field strength of about 100 microgauss is probable, on a par with that found in the inner regions of starburst galaxies.},
